### FAQs

## Who the hell is Josh?

I'm sure you meant *What* the hell is Josh, and it's quite simply the easiest data storage system you'll ever encounter. Josh will help you
store any JSON-based data simply, effectively, into any popuplar database back-end.

* Josh is trustworthy: He's never lost a single bit yet, and not about to start.
* Josh is dependable: As long as your database doesn't fail, Josh won't fail.
* Josh is speedy: He has a minimal footprint, walks around light a ballerina, silent as a mouse.
* Josh cares about you: He's friendly, knows his stuff, is documented well, and won't leave you in the dark.

### Why use Josh?

The best reason to use Josh is quite simply to get a project up and running as quickly as possible with as little effort as possible when it
comes to the database interaction layer.  It does this by removing the complexity of setting up an ORM or learning a database language, while
still giving you all the power it can muster.

### When NOT to use Josh?

If you think you can do better, if you already know database interactions or ORMs, or you don't trust database wrappers made by other people...
well in any of those cases I don't even know why you're on this page, go on now, `git out --of:here` and go make some good apps, you don't need this!
